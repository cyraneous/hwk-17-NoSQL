NoSQL: Fitness Tracker 

I have created a Mongo DB database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
A Node CLI that takes employee information and generates an HTML summary page.

User should be able to view, create and track daily workouts. Users should also be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day and to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise the distance travelled should be able to be tracked.
